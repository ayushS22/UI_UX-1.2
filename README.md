# Here I Create a responsive landing page for a SaaS product that includes:
# A hero section with a strong CTA.
# Sections for product features, testimonials, and pricing plans.
 # Ensure that the layout adapts seamlessly between desktop and mobile devices.
# Hero Section:
# Purpose: The hero section introduces the product and includes a call-to-action (CTA) button, encouraging users to take action right away.
# Mobile-Friendly: Text is centered and uses large, readable fonts for all devices.
# CTA: A prominent button encourages users to start their free trial.
# Product Features Section:
# Purpose: This section highlights key features of the product in three columns.
# Mobile-Friendly: On smaller screens (below 768px), the layout switches to a vertical stack for easier viewing.
# Testimonials Section:
# Purpose: Builds trust by showing real user feedback.
# Mobile-Friendly: Testimonials are displayed in blocks with sufficient spacing, ensuring the content doesnâ€™t feel cramped on smaller screens.
# Pricing Plans Section:
# Purpose: Shows different pricing options clearly with brief descriptions.
# Mobile-Friendly: The pricing plans adjust into a single column layout on smaller screens to avoid clutter.
# Footer:
# Purpose: Displays copyright information.
# Mobile-Friendly: Simple and centered footer text.
# Responsive Design:
# The layout uses flexible containers and percentages for width, ensuring the page adjusts across different screen sizes.
# On smaller screens, elements stack vertically for better readability and usability.
# Media queries (@media) ensure the layout adapts when the screen width is less than 768px.
# How to Use:
# Create two files:
# index.html for the HTML structure.
# styles.css for the styling.
# Open index.html in a browser to see how the page looks.
# This design creates a clear, professional, and easy-to-navigate landing page that works well on both desktop and mobile devices
